## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Build

```bash
cd dns-filter-app

# Install dependencies
make deps

# Build the application
make build
```

### Step 2: Run

```bash
# Linux/macOS (requires sudo for port 53)
sudo ./build/dns-filter

# Windows (run as Administrator)
.\build\dns-filter.exe
```

### Step 3: Configure DNS

Set your system DNS to `127.0.0.1`

**Linux**:
```bash
echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf
```

**Windows**: Control Panel → Network → IPv4 Properties → DNS

**macOS**: System Preferences → Network → Advanced → DNS

### Step 4: Access Dashboard

Open browser: `http://localhost:8080`

Login:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `changeme`

**Done! Your network is now protected.** 🎉

## 🔧 Configuration

Edit `configs/config.yaml`:

```yaml
server:
  dns_port: 53
  api_port: 8080
  upstream_dns:
    - "8.8.8.8:53"
    - "1.1.1.1:53"

filtering:
  enabled: true
  block_categories:
    - adult
    - gambling
    - malware
  block_action: "nxdomain"

blocklists:
  auto_update_interval: 24
  sources:
    - name: "StevenBlack Unified"

## 🌐 Network-Wide Protection

### Router Configuration

1. Login to your router (usually `192.168.1.1`)
2. Find DHCP/DNS settings
3. Set Primary DNS to your server's IP
4. Save and reboot

Now **all devices** on your network are protected!
